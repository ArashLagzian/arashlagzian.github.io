I received my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from Sharif University of Technology in 2023 and my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Hakim Sabzevari University in 2017. Currently, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Manopart. My journey began with a deep interest in technology and intelligent systems, leading me to excel in math and programming. I gained valuable experience in artificial intelligence, teaching, and patent examination. At Sharif University, I ranked first among engineering students. I am now focused on Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and IoT research, working on innovative projects and papers in these fields.
